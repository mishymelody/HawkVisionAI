## Inspiration
A highly unfortunate fact remains that criminals can remain free due to crimes being undetected, slow response times, and victims held at gunpoint and unable to alert the authorities, proving a need to right these wrongs and stop these crimes before they progress too far. 

## What it does
It is a threat detection algorithm that has enhanced security integrated within the smart surveillance systems that can detect any threat (handheld weaponry) and suspicious behaviours from afar.

* Implementation of state of the art object detection and classification algorithms
* Artificially Intelligent system providing enhanced security integrated within the surveillance systems
* Smart threat and suspicious behaviour detection
* Detection support for situations like pre-initiation of a mass shooting and bank robberies or street muggings
* Removes the need for humans to keep track of security manually
* Reduces the action time by immediately alerting the police and security authorities

## How we built it
* Azure virtual machine to train Machine Learning models and speed up the process using GPUs
* Azure's cognitive services API for image classification and object detection
* Python as backend
* Bootstrap and JavaScript on the frontend
